# Soccer-Visualization
In this project, we study the shoot habit of a soccer player through visualization techniques. We proposed a new visualization Matlab model for a soccer game in which we can analyse the likelihood of shot from the field and the likelihood of shot target. 
We categorizes each shot as: 
- off target
- saved
- scored

We further demonstrate a visualization method for analysis of player’s habit, specially for the balls in target.
